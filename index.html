                    Physically disabled and the temporarily injured students most times have a difficult time finding a fast and efficient way to enter buildings for class, dining, study, activities, and more. This can lead to embarrassment or even tardiness to class over something they have no control over. Simple directions would greatly help them find an easier path.

                    My Teamates and myself put our heads together and came up with a great deal of ideas for our plan to help those in need of directions due to physical issues.
